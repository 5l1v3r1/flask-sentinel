# Flask-Oauth2
Oauth2 authentication server for the `Resource Owner Password Credentials
Grant` described in [RFC 6749 (Section 1.3.3)][1].

Powered by Flask, Redis and MongoDB.

## Experiment
This is WIP and you should fully expect me to force-push from time to time. To
be honest I still consider this an experiment and I'm using github as a backup
tool. 

## Acknowledgement
This work is based on the [yoloAPI][2] example prjoect.
