OAuth2 Provider for the Resource Owner Password Credentials
Grant scheme, as described in [RFC 6749 (Section 1.3.3)][1].

## Experiment
This is WIP and you should fully expect me to force-push from time to time. To
be honest I still consider this an experiment and I'm using github as a backup
tool. 

## License

distributed under the [BSD license][7].

## Acknowledgement
